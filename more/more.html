        <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In our country, "Road to Mount Olympia" (RtMO) is a top-rated game
            show tailored for high school students. Established in 1999 by VTV -
            Vietnam Television, the national broadcaster of Vietnam, it offers
            an annual opportunity for 144 Grade 11 contestants to demonstrate
            their knowledge to millions of viewers nationwide. The grand prize
            for the highest winner every year is a full-ride scholarship to
            Swinburne University of Technology and 50,000 USD for living
            expenses. We have always been big fans of this TV program and dreamt
            of participating as contestants. Unfortunately, despite our tireless
            efforts to prepare ourselves, due to several circumstances, our
            dream never came true. Nevertheless, we do not give up; now as
            bachelor students, with the spirit of "sharing is caring," we have
            decided to develop a website that simulates RtMO's format. Through
            this initiative, we aim to assist future generations in realizing
            their ambitions of taking part in such a prestigious show,
            leveraging our skills to contribute to their success partly. You
