        <h2>USER STORIES</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            As students who want to participate in a contest that challenges
            their knowledge across various fields, we want to create a dedicated
            platform where they can compete with our peers. There are three
            kinds of users:
          </p>
          <li>
            <span>Player:</span> Users can enter contest rooms by simply
            entering a password, without the need for account registration. They
            can interact with the contest interface using keyboard and mouse
            inputs, including signaling to the MC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Master of Ceremonies:</span> Responsible for reading questions
            from the screen during contests, the MC doesn't require any
            additional actions. In online matches, the MC can also serve as a
            technician.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Technician:</span> This role involves technical tasks such as
            inputting and uploading questions, selecting questions to display,
            and managing the countdown timer for answering questions. With the
            extension feature for server management, technicians will require
            accounts to access their question banks and initiate matches without
            affecting other servers.
          </li>
        </ul>
